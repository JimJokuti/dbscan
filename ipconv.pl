# This is a simple script that interactively converts an IP address to
# its decimal equivalent. This can sometimes be used to bypass web content
# filtering devices as not all will convert the decimal to an IP and then a
# hostname.
#
# prompt for an IP
print "Enter an IP Address: ";
 
 
# get the users input
$_ = <STDIN>;
 
 
# remove the newline "\n" character
chomp($_);
 
 
# should validate the input, but this was a simple/quick program
$converteddecimal = ip2dec($_);
$convertedip = dec2ip($converteddecimal);
 
print "\nIP address: $_\n";
